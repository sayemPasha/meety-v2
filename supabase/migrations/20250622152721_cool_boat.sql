  # Fix Real-time Sync Issues

  1. Problem Analysis
    - Real-time subscriptions may not work properly with overly permissive RLS policies
    - The current policies use `USING (true)` which can cause issues with real-time filters
    - Need to ensure real-time subscriptions can properly filter and receive updates

  2. Solution
    - Update RLS policies to be more specific for real-time compatibility
    - Ensure proper permissions for real-time subscriptions
    - Add explicit policies for different operations

  3. Changes
    - Drop and recreate RLS policies with better real-time compatibility
    - Ensure anon role has proper access for collaborative features
    - Add specific policies for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
